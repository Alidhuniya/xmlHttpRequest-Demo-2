i thought mom and dad 

were supposed to last forever

but i guess i was too young

i didnt know any better

you walked out

you never told us why

you never call now

i guess you've found another life

but i thought that mom and dad

were supposed to last forever

but i guess i was too young

i didnt know any better

and now you've moved on 

youve learnt to live your life way better

and im stuck with the pain 

im stuck,im stuck

im stuck behind this mystery 

the mystery -" why did it happen,

 i guess im the problem here, anyways"
 
 but atleast you're happy now.
