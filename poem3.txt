#Wife

When the mountain looked insurmountable
Your uncompromising stance made it assailable

When situations looked so scary and bleak
Your raw determination hauled us towards the peak

When the road to the top quaked and meandered
You steadied the boat continually and we never surrendered

When our supplications seemed to defy our prayers
Your rock- steady disposition made us not to waiver

I salute you woman of courage
The rock of Gilbratar and the ultimate conqueror
You are the Queen of my heart!
